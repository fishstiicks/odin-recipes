        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Tide Pods have been said to "not be edible", but who is truly proving this? Doctors? And what do doctors have? A degree? Don't listen to education or sense, listen to the allure of colorful Tide Pods. Think about the way they would melt in your mouth.</p>
        <p>If you weren't a coward, you would eat a Tide Pod. Much like colorful toads are meant to be eaten, Tide Pods are as well.</p>
