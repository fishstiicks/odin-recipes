        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Garfield's Beautiful Lasagna is a lasagna to top all lasagnas. It may be the best lasagana in the world. If every lasagna were made from Garfield's sweet paws, maybe then there would be world peace. If we all ate this lasagna, there would be no war. That's how good this lasagna is.</p>
        <p>Any claims to Garfield's Beautiful Lasagna being a "posion" or "dangerous" are false and should be taken with a grain of salt. The kind of grain of salt that is not needed when consuming this lasagna, because it is perfectly salted. </p>
